## Credit

This colorscheme was initially generated by converting antoineboulanger's [Civic Color Scheme](https://github.com/antoineboulanger/civic) 
for TextMate to VIM using [Coloration](https://github.com/sickill/coloration) by Marcin Kulik. 
This colorscheme is originally based from Apple's Xcode Civic theme.

It was slightly altered to have more contrast and brighter colors.

## Installation

Copy `civic.vim` to your `~/.vim/colors/` folder (Create it if it doesn't exist).

Make sure to add `set t_Co=256` to your `~/.vimrc` file to enable 256 colors. 
Or `set termguicolors` to enable truecolor support if your terminal supports it.


## Notes

- Enable bold fonts in your terminal for better highlighting.
- Works well with [vim-javascript](https://github.com/pangloss/vim-javascript) for JavaScript syntax highlighting.
